% For most architectures mym should work as is.
% Supported systems include : linux_32, linux_64, windows_32, macosx_intel
% If matlab complains that mym is a script, then you need to recompile it for your system.
% To compile you will need to run something like

mex -I/usr/include/mysql -lmysqlclient -lz mym.cpp

% In order for this to compile successfully your system will need
% 1) C++ compiler
% 2) mysql-dev
% 3) zlib-dev
